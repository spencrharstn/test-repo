## Why?
Because there comes a time in everybody's life that they need to test something before they roll it out.

## Now what?
We're gonna run some git commands to see what we can do with this and learn all about it. Fun, right?

## This is a new section
This will be added via Github desktop.

## What about the command line?
Well let's give this a try!

### Hey how about on another system?
Yeah, that'd be cool.

### Using VSCode?
YUP!

### I'm created using a branch!
Like a stick on a tree. Let's do it again.

### How about a fork?
This comes from a fork made by my someone else.

### And more?
Quite possibly. We'll see.
